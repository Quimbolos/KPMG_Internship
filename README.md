# KPMG_Internship
Utilising the labelled dataset of three existing datasets (Customer demographic, Customer address, and Transactions), the project's goal is to recommend the most valuable new customers, out of the 1000, to be targeted by the marketing team for effective marketing campaigns and improved business growth.

This repo contains my personal developed submissions for the 3 modules of the KPMG Online Internship - Data Analytics.
